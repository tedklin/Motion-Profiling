# Motion-Profiling
Creates text file with data for graphing trapezoidal or s-curve motion profiles

Input desired distance, max acceleration, max velocity, and clock speed.
Output data for velocity and distance over time

Includes example data file with parameters: 
```
  distance = 50;
  max acceleration = 2;
  max velocity = 5;
  clock speed = 0.1;
```
